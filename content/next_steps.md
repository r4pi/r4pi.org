# Next steps

Now that you have R installed, you might be wondering what you can do with it?

## Understanding the basics

### R4DS

We think the best place to start is by working through the exercises in the book 
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (often just referred to as "R4DS").
You can buy a physical copy of the book, but you can also read the whole thing
online, for free!

### ModernDive

Another great book that's more statistics-heavy that you can read for free
online is, "[Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com)"
(you can just call this one "ModernDive").

### Learning Statistics with R
