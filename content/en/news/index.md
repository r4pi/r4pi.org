## 2022-03-09 - Added a Spanish translation

The R4Pi team is dedicated to supporting our users as well as we possibly can
using the limited resources at out disposal.
To better support our users and further the reach of the project,
we're excited to announce that this site is now also [available in Spanish](/es/).
This translation is the work of R4Pi team member,
[Andr√©s](https://mastodon.social/@andresrcs), who's done an incredible job on 
the translation.

If you'd like to contribute a translation, please
[let us know](https://github.com/r4pi/r4pi.org/issues/new)!

## 2022-03-04 - Updated website

We've just updated the website from vanilla [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
to [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
On the surface, this might seem like a minor change, but it will allow us to
be a lot more flexible with the site in the future.
Hopefully you'll like the new dark mode too.
