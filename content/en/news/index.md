## 2023-11-26 - Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm support is (finally) here

The installation instructions were updated to support Bookworm about a week ago and feedback so far has been positive.
We didn’t want to abandon Bullseye users though, so the existing builds will continue for now.

Unfortunately, continuing to support Bullseye meant that we needed to wait on a new machine (a shiny new Raspberry Pi 5 system) before builds and testing could commence, hence the long delay.
We’ll try and move more quickly in the future.

Finally, since the default OS install is now 64 bit for most systems, Bookworm will also be the first time we haven’t produced 32 bit builds.
Our logs show very few users installing 32 bit packages, so hopefully the impact will be low.
If this change impacts you negatively and you’re unable to upgrade to a 64 bit OS for whatever reason, please let us know.
Bullseye builds (including 32 but) will continue until it looks like downloads have dried up.

The work involved in adding Bookworm support has already significantly improved our internal build processes and will hopefully help us to be more flexible in the future.


## 2022-03-09 - Added a Spanish translation

The R4Pi team is dedicated to supporting our users as well as we possibly can
using the limited resources at our disposal.
To better support our users and further the reach of the project,
we're excited to announce that this site is now also [available in Spanish](/es/).
This translation is the work of R4Pi team member,
[Andrés](https://mastodon.social/@andresrcs), who's done an incredible job on 
the translation.

If you'd like to contribute a translation, please
[let us know](https://github.com/r4pi/r4pi.org/issues/new)!

## 2022-03-04 - Updated website

We've just updated the website from vanilla [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
to [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
On the surface, this might seem like a minor change, but it will allow us to
be a lot more flexible with the site in the future.
Hopefully you'll like the new dark mode too.
