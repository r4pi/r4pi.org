## 2022-03-4 - Updated website

We've just updated the website from vanilla [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
On the surface, this might seem like a minor change, but it will allow us to be a lot more flexible with the site in the future. Hopefully you'll like the new dark mode too.
